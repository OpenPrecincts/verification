    Description from MGGG's 2018 Virginia House of Delegates report:
    At each step, we (uniformly) randomly select a pair of adjacent districts and
    merge all of their blocks in to a single unit. Then, we generate a spanning tree
    for the blocks of the merged unit with the Kruskal/Karger algorithm. Finally,
    we cut an edge of the tree at random, checking that this separates the region
    into two new districts that are population balanced.

    Example usage::

        from functools import partial
        from gerrychain import MarkovChain
        from gerrychain.proposals import recom

        # ...define constraints, accept, partition, total_steps here...

        # Ideal population:
        pop_target = sum(partition["population"].values()) / len(partition)

        proposal = partial(
            recom, pop_col="POP10", pop_target=pop_target, epsilon=.05, node_repeats=10
        )

        chain = MarkovChain(proposal, constraints, accept, partition, total_steps)
