class Election:
    """Represents the data of one election, with races conducted in each part of
    the partition.

    As we vary the districting plan, we can use the same node-level vote totals
    to tabulate hypothetical elections. To do this manually with tallies, we would
    have to maintain tallies for each party, as well as the total number of votes,
    and then compute the electoral results and percentages from scratch every time.
    To make this simpler, this class provides an :class:`ElectionUpdater` to manage
    these tallies. The updater returns an :class:`ElectionResults` class giving
    a convenient view of the election results, with methods like
    :meth:`~ElectionResults.wins` or :meth:`~ElectionResults.percent` for common queries
    the user might make on election results.

    Example usage::

        # Assuming your nodes have attributes "2008_D", "2008_R"
        # with (for example) 2008 senate election vote totals
        election = Election(
            "2008 Senate",
            {"Democratic": "2008_D", "Republican": "2008_R"},
            alias="2008_Sen"
        )

        # Assuming you already have a graph and assignment:
        partition = Partition(
            graph,
            assignment,
            updaters={"2008_Sen": election}
        )

        # The updater returns an ElectionResults instance, which
        # we can use (for example) to see how many seats a given
        # party would win in this partition using this election's
        # vote distribution:
        partition["2008_Sen"].wins("Republican")
